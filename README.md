EventManagementSystem
=====================
This is an event management system which can be used to register the participants for multiple events. 
Participants can register in single player events or can create a team and then register for multi player event. 
This project came out of my need for registering the participants for my college's technical fest.
The project has been made in ASP.NET web forms, MySQL 5.2 as the backend database and uses Repository Design Pattern.
